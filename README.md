# wavreader
This is a small command line utility which can read a .wav file, chop it up into slices, and render those slices out as the waveforms of a Famitracker Namco 163 instrument. One may splice the printed instrument data into a .txt project file generated by Famitracker, and retrieve the generated instrument from there.

Options:
- ``-i`` input wav file path.
- ``-s`` generated waveform length.
- ``-c`` how many slices will be made of the file and turned into waveforms.
- ``-l`` length in audio samples each slice.
- ``-n`` instrument number (set to unused instrument number to splice into .txt project file).
